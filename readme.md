## Application running requirements

- The app requires python version 3.12.1 to be in installed, if you want to check which version of Python you have install please open your terminal and run the following command ```python3 --version```. 

- If you do not have Python 3 installed no version will be displayed, that's okay, but please download it from the [Official Python Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) before downloading the application files. This also applies if you have Python version 2 intsalled.
